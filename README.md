# Lynkz-Shapes-Puzzle

Hi There!

This respository contains the solution to the shapes puzzle. This was accomplished using a .NET 6 Web API Backend and a React.JS Frontend in substitution
 for Angluar, as approved by Justin.

As with any repository good documentation is always good convention and as such see below for instructions on how to start:

## Quick Start
1. Copy the repo link and clone it into preferably Visual Studio Code to run both the Frontend and Backend.
2. Install all recommended dependencies as per VS Code and download node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. To run the Frontend, enter via the terminal: `npm start`
4. To build the Backend: Hit `F5` or start debugging.
5. Happy Testing!

<strong>Notes:</strong> 
- Support for 3D shapes was not possible due to time constraints with current project releases and demos. However, I would achieve this by adding an optional depth 
measurement to be parsed from the sentence with a quantity which would then be used in the frontend. I would then create 3D models of the respective shapes using Three.js, React Three Fiber and React Three Drei libraies.
- Additionally, rate limiting would be implemented on the API Endpoint alongside with refactored utility methods for polygon shapes and drawing utilities to boost future reusability.

Thank you for the taking the time view the solution, feel free to explore my <a href=https://github.com/navidahmed-github>GitHub Portfolio</a> to get a better idea of my technical ability, hope to get in touch soon!
